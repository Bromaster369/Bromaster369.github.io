As time goes by. The more I learn about coding the more I realize how similar things are in life. We live by a formula or a process. Although the creative side is at the edge of frustration and failed experiments. The tension that is created to build something is priceless. I decided to learn code to create because that is what I live for. The possibilities are endless in this area as it is with music. It is what keeps me motivated and ready to go. Not to mention how organized and attention to details you must have when creating a software or a song. It makes you want to dive in and submerged yourself in new ways to confront a situation. When things are done, which honestly are never done as there is always something you want to improve. You get that moment of releasing that tension just like music or shall I say the 'Drop'? Well that's life right? Tension and release and there you have it a mix of challenges full of try and fail to finally have a few victories.
