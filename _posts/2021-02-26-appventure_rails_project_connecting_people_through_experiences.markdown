AppVenture is a platform that allows users to share their travel experiences to other users and be able to arrange more trips with more travelers having the same interests. Some users will encounter themselves in a situation having the resources, time, and destination but no one to go with. This creates a sense of community and get them closer to other people to make their dreams come true. AppVenture is not like any other social media platform. Instead of getting people hooked on a smartphone to addictive content. AppVenture allows people to go out and experience the real world.  

Models 

AppVenture includes four models: User, experience, comment, and category . These model files include class definitions, associations, validation and scope methods.

Views

AppVenture's views is where we show our client our forms and allow them to interact with the app. Either by having information submitted or displayed.

Controllers 
Appventure's controllers to control actions such as index, new, create, edit, update, set our strong params, and use our helper methods.

Helpers
AppVenture's helpers are a great way to abstract and separate concerns so we have a cleaner code. This helpers are set whenever we have repetitive code in our views.

Partials
Partials allow us to have cleaner code through our app when it is repetitive.

Associations 
Thanks to our associations we get to use metaprogramming. These macros allow us to have a belongs_to relationship, has_many and has_many through. This makes it more precise and accurate to a real world interaction.

Omniauth
AppVenture uses omniauth for google so users can login with their emails addresses and make it simpler instead of filling in the information at signup and signin.

Conclusion 
AppVenture provides a space for users with time, resources and destination to accomplish their wildest dreams of going whereever they want and share their experiences to people with same interests and set new destinations with these users. This makes a world more connected and concious to our environment and influences positively our mental health.
