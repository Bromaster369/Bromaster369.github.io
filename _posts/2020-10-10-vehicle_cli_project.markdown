It was so interesting doing my CLI project. I chose to make it about vehicles where the user has the opportunity to interact with the interface and search for any make's vehicle. This solves a problem when it comes to finding details about the make you are interesting in and have the chance to find out how many vehicles exist for that specific make.
Details come in handy as they nurture us with information about the make's name, make's model, make id, model id, and even the vehicle type. You will be submerged in a list of your favorite vehicles and will be amazed by the vast variety of vehicles. 

The process was intriguing as I went through it. I had the chance to apply the concepts I learnt and thanks to my cohort lead I was able to unpuzzle my tangled thoughts to finally make my program friendly and useful to my user. I did find situations where I felt frustrated but this is what programming is about right? Solving problems from different angles until you find the right one and yet being open to change it as I will be evaluated. Hopefully won't need many changes as I tried to make it as abstrast as possible.
