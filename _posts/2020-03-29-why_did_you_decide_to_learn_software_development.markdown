It all started when I was in college. We were required to create our business plan so we could show what our business ideas were all about. There was always this limitation on materializing my ideas as they required certain knowledge of software development. But now I can change that and contribute in my own way.

To this day I regret it but it gave me the courage to make that regrettable moment a strenght and bring those ideas to life putting myself in a position where I could learn about creating software and have a deep understanding of how programming works. I feel very proud of myself for taking this decision as I am not just lured to the high paying jobs this industry has to offer but the chance to learn and create. That is the most rewarding feeling a person can have. 

This experience has taught me so far on how to be more disciplined, resourceful and getting things done. Being surrounded by people who took the same decision is inspiring. It shows how some of us want to grow and have a deeper impact on our society.
